        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The tech skills gap describes the growing disconnect between the digital skills employers need and the
            skills many students, job-seekers, and workers currently have. This isn’t about a lack of interest — it’s
            about a world where technology evolves faster than education and workplace training can keep up.
            This guide is designed to orient you. Instead of drowning you in statistics, it walks you through the why,
            the impact, and the pathways forward. My goal is to help you make sense of a complicated topic by
            highlighting the clearest insights from my research and my Zotero library.
            Whether you’re exploring careers, preparing for graduation, or simply trying to understand what “digital
            skills” really mean today, this guide offers a starting point.
        </p>

    <section id="panel-problem" class="panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-problem" hidden>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            The skill gap exists because technology changes faster than most institutions can respond. Employers often
            need workers who understand modern tools — data analytics, cloud platforms, UX, AI-assisted workflows — but
            college curricula, training programs, and outdated job descriptions don’t always reflect those expectations.
            There’s also a mismatch in how skills are defined. Some companies want specific software experience; others
            want general digital literacy; others want the “ability to learn new tools quickly.” The result is confusion
            for employers, students, and job seekers.
            Finally, access plays a major role. Not everyone has equal exposure to computers, high-speed internet,
            technical electives, or professional development programs. These disparities widen the gap, especially in
            rural areas and underserved communities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="panel-impact" class="panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-impact" hidden>
        <h2>Impact The tech skills gap affects every layer of the workforce:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Students and recent grads discover that their degrees don’t match job listings.</li>
            <li>Employers spend significant time and money retraining staff or outsourcing projects.</li>
            <li>Businesses lose productivity when teams can’t use digital tools efficiently.</li>
            <li>Communities fall behind when access to training isn’t equal.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This gap doesn’t just slow industry — it limits opportunity. As digital tools become essential
            across every field, people without access to training face greater barriers to advancement.
            Use the chart below as a snapshot of where skill demand is rising the fastest.

        <h2>Solutions</h2>

        <p>Some of the most effective ways to close the tech skills gap include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Project-based learning that uses real workplace tools.</li>
            <li>Micro-credentials and certificates aligned with industry needs.</li>
            <li>Stronger partnerships between companies and education programs.</li>
            <li>Accessible online learning through Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Google Career Certificates, and IBM SkillsBuild.</li>
            <li>Internships and apprenticeships that give hands-on experience with current technologies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The key to closing the skills gap is flexible, targeted learning that adapts quickly
            as technology continues to evolve.

        <h2>Future</h2>

        <p>
            The future of work will require hybrid skill sets: part technical, part analytical, and part human-centered.
            By 2030, most jobs will involve AI-assisted tools, data-driven decision making, and continuous reskilling.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Knowing how to work with automated and AI-powered systems.</li>
            <li>Understanding and interpreting data in everyday workplace tasks.</li>
            <li>Solving problems creatively in digital environments.</li>
            <li>Communicating clearly across teams, tools, and platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My reflection as a Digital Media and MIS student:
            This research reinforced that success doesn’t come from mastering one tool — it comes from staying adaptable.
            Learning new technologies, experimenting, and continuously updating your skill set will matter more than ever.

                Explains the curriculum–practice mismatch. Great for understanding <em>why</em> grads feel underprepared and
