        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As technology continues to evolve, many industries are struggling to keep up with the growing demand for digital skills.
            The tech skills gap refers to the mismatch between what employers need and what job-seekers or recent graduates can provide.
            This gap affects business innovation, career development, and long-term workforce stability.
            The purpose of this guide is to explain the causes of the tech skills gap, examine its impact on both students and employers,
            and provide insights into how individuals can adapt by building relevant technical and analytical skills.
        </p>

    <section id="panel-problem" class="panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-problem" hidden>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Employers in the technology and business sectors frequently report challenges finding candidates with the right combination
            of programming, data analysis, and problem-solving skills. Many higher education programs have been slow to update their
            curricula to meet these modern demands. The constant advancement of tools, languages, and platforms makes this gap even
            more difficult to close.
            In addition, unequal access to technical education and training contributes to the issue, leaving underrepresented groups
            behind in emerging fields such as AI, cybersecurity, and software engineering.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="panel-impact" class="panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-impact" hidden>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>
            The skills gap creates a chain reaction that affects both sides of the job market.
            Graduates often struggle to find positions that match their academic preparation, while employers spend significant time
            and money retraining staff or outsourcing projects. This reduces innovation and can slow overall productivity.

    <section id="panel-solutions" class="panel" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-solutions" hidden>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Organizations and educators are working to address the gap through new training models and innovative approaches to learning.
            Online platforms and certifications now make it easier for people to reskill or upskill from anywhere.
            Micro-credentials, industry partnerships, and internship programs give students hands-on experience in current technologies.
            Examples of helpful platforms include Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and IBM SkillsBuild, all of which focus on flexible learning
            and targeted skill-building for high-demand fields.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
            Reports predict that by 2025, the most valuable skills will include analytical thinking, creative problem-solving, and AI literacy.
            Success in the digital economy will depend on lifelong learning and the ability to adapt as technology changes.
            For students entering the digital media and information systems fields, developing a growth mindset and pursuing continuous
            learning opportunities will be key to staying competitive.

                <h3>The Gap between Higher Education and the Software Industry</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Explains the curriculum–practice mismatch. Great for understanding <em>why</em> grads feel underprepared and
                how internships, micro-credentials, and project-based courses close that gap.

                A crisp industry snapshot you can quote for stakes: the shortage hits productivity and security.
